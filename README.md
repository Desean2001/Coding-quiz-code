# Coding-quiz-code

User Story;

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria;

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

Used help from Stack Overflow and W3Schools to help form some functions. 

When page is opened you can click a start quiz button to loop through an array of questions and answers to present the user with multiple choice questions.

The user, when either all questions are answered or time is elapsed, is prompted for their first and last name and those along with the score is saved to local storage.

When you click the display scores button you are brought to a seperate page that displays the local stored scores.
